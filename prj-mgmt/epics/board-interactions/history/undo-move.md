# Undo Move

As a user, I want to be able to undo my last move so that I can correct mistakes or change my strategy. 

## Acceptance Criteria
- The user can click an "Undo" and "Redo" button to revert the last move made.
- The buttons should use intuitive icons (e.g., a backward arrow for undo and a forward arrow for redo).
- Hovering or long pressing the buttons should display a tooltip with "Step Back" for undo and "Step Forward" for redo.
- The game state updates to reflect the board position before the last move.
- The user can keep undoing moves to review the game all the way back to the start.
