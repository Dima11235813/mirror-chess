# Persist Settings Feature

## Default

As a user, I want my settings to be saved and persist across sessions so that I don't have to reconfigure them each time I use the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
- User settings should be saved locally on the user's device.
- When the user closes and reopens the application, their settings should be automatically loaded and applied.
- If the user changes a setting, it should be saved immediately and persist for future sessions.
- There should be no loss of settings data when the application is updated to a new version.
