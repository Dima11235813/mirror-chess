# Default Board Feature

## Perspective

As a user, I want to see the chess board from a top-down perspective so that I can easily view and interact with the pieces.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The chess board should be displayed in a top-down view.
- All pieces should be clearly visible and distinguishable from one another.
- The board should be oriented such that the bottom side is the perspective of the player controlling the white pieces.
- The board should be centered on the screen and scaled appropriately for the display size.
- The board should have a clear and intuitive layout, with rows and columns labeled for easy reference.
