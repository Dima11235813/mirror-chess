# Ionic Button Component Feature

## Customizable Button Styles

As a dev of the application, I want to have buttons that can be easily customized in terms of color, size, and shape so that they fit the overall design of the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Implement an Ionic button component wrapper component in ./components/ionic/button/* that allows customization of color, size, and shape through properties.
- Use the ionic button component docs to enable a strong type for the props to pass to our wrapper component.
- Ensure that the button component is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- Write unit tests to verify that the button component behaves as expected with different property values.
- Document the usage of the button component in the project documentation.
- This should be a button-readme.md file, in the same folder as the component, that explains how to use the component, what properties are available, and provides examples of different configurations.
- We should include a button mocks file that provides mocks of different inputs to the component for testing and documentation purposes.
