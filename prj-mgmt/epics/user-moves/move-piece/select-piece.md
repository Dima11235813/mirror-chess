# Select Piece

As a user, I want to be able to select a piece on the board so that I can move it.

## Acceptance Criteria
- I can click on a piece on the board, when I select it, then the piece should be highlighted to indicate it is selected.
- If I click on an empty space or outside the board, any selected piece should be deselected.
- If I hover over a piece that's not selectable (e.g., an opponent's piece in a turn-based game), it should not be highlighted or selectable.
- When I hover or long press on a piece a distinct visual effect should indicate that the piece is being hovered over or long pressed.
